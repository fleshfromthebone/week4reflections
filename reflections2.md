# Week 4 Saturday Brief review

I don't have alot of time to review this in one go before my CPU Overheats but I will go through the main 3 tabs on Tailwind

### The Utility Fundamentals Section
I do not know alot about writing in CSS, and it seems that I will not be learning that in *this* class (I am in another web design/coding class so hopefully I will learn there)

From what I'm picking up in the first few minutes, Tailwind is a tool for trimming the fat off of my CSS code and simplifies it using pre-existing script. Some examples I could actually understand:

`hover` `focus` and `active`
- Let's me have a fancy effect on buttons when the cursor is hovering above a button.
- not really anything practical or essential, but a neat feature if you value web design
- - It's alot more complicated than what I can fit in a brief summary, other than

`table`, `table-row`, `table-cell`, etc
- Allows me to make a table list with categories and exta info/classifications
- On the example on their website they have a table with a list of songs, along with their artists and year of release.

`required` `invalid`, `disabled`
- If I am ever coding a sign in box, these modifiers allow me to highlight the selected text box in red, require it to be filled, etc.

`flex`, `inline-flex` 
- this is what I mean by how little I know about CSS.
- creates alligned and formatted containers of text

`hidden`
- hides elements.
- <div> class="hidden ...">01</div>
- simple as

`sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `2xl`
- crunch some numbers to properly display a readable box on any browser shape
- their example explanation:
  > By default, the outer div is display: block, but by adding the md:flex utility, it becomes display: flex on medium screens and larger.
