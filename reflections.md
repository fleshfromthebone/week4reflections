# Week 4 What I have learned

It's week 4, I realize that I shouldve been using **Markdown** more often, half my family is sick and my computer keeps crashing on me ðŸ˜Ž everything is *awesome!* But this isnt a sob story about me. I'm here to discuss what I could piece together from this week's videos.

### What it all means (to me) and what I have learned.
 My brief summary of the office hours video: So far we are bundling up everything we have learned so far, file management, git commands, terminal operation, using VS Code vs notepad ++, etc.
- VS Code and Notepad++ operate somewhat similar. I can write HTML and CSS in notepad the same way i could in VS Code, however notepad can only take me so far without the extensions and tools in VS Code.
- Notepad is alot more basic than VS Code, at the cost of being a professional tool. VS Code allows me to view more than just HTML and CSS format
- If i wish to view my progress or view changes in my code, i just need to open Git and run a `log` command, and a `history` to view my command history in Git.
- `cd` (change directory).
- `npm`, (node package manager), no `npm` will not work without a package.json file, which is where the nodes needed go when the command is run in Git. the command lets me soft-launch and preview my web page.
- Stylelint: The part of the .json file that gives the HTML file its looks such as text and formatting. The CSS janitor in short terms.
- VITE: The "front end tool of web design". Helps fix code and do most of the Javascript stuff for me.

### Does this make sense to me? Dislikes and Confusion.
  I won't lie. No. This is bloody witchcraft to me. Coders are freaking wizards. This is all fairly intimidating and I am barely piecing all these strings of code together. But I feel that is the coder's experience.
Also I still don't understand what VITE is. All I got from this is that it helps with the front end side of my web program with stuff such as "instant server start" and "HMR". I feel this tool exists just fto cut the middle man when working with Javascript. Lets take a look at [Vite's "why page"](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html)

> Vite aims to address these issues by leveraging new advancements in the ecosystem: the availability of native ES modules in the browser, and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages.

I dont know what this means. I don't know what bundling is. This is alien speak to me. I am scratching my head trying to piece together what this is supposed to replace at all.
Feel free to give me a brief explanation, or a much more blunt summary like "it does this so it can work." Other than that it's my only complaint this week.

### Do I see myself actually using these tools?
I sure hope so. Notepad++ as simple as it is, I really do not see myself using it in this class or the professional world. It's a good tool for practicing HTML and seeing if the code works at a barebones level, but I think I am just better off doing it in VS Code, where a good portion of work is actually done other than in GitBash.
